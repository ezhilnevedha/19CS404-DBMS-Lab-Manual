# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
## NAME: EZHIL NEVEDHA K
## REG NO: 212223230055
## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a query to display all the customers whose ID is the difference between the salesperson ID of Mc Lyon and 2001.

salesman table

name             type
---------------  ---------------
salesman_id      numeric(5)
name                 varchar(30)
city                    varchar(15)
commission       decimal(5,2)

customer table

name         type
-----------  ----------
customer_id  int
cust_name    text
city         text
grade        int
salesman_id  int

```sql
SELECT customer_id, cust_name, city, grade, salesman_id
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT salesman_id - 2001 FROM salesman WHERE name = 'Mc Lyon');
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders generated in New York city. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.

SALESMAN TABLE

name               type
-----------        ----------
salesman_id  numeric(5)
name             varchar(30)
city                 varchar(15)
commission   decimal(5,2)

ORDERS TABLE

name            type
----------      ----------
ord_no          int
purch_amt    real
ord_date       text
customer_id  int
salesman_id  int

```sql
SELECT o.ord_no, o.purch_amt, o.ord_date, o.customer_id, o.salesman_id
FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.city = 'New York';
```

**Question 3**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find the order values greater than the average order value of 10th October 2012. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

Note: date should be yyyy-mm-dd format

ORDERS TABLE

name            type
----------     ----------
ord_no          int
purch_amt    real
ord_date       text
customer_id  int
salesman_id  int

```sql
SELECT 
    ord_no,
    purch_amt,
    ord_date,
    customer_id,
    salesman_id
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    purch_amt > (
        SELECT 
            AVG(purch_amt)
        FROM 
            orders
        WHERE 
            ord_date = '2012-10-10'
    );

```
